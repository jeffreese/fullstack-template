# Development Workflow

This documents our development process — how we go from an idea to merged code.

## Branch Workflow

All changes go through pull requests. Never push directly to `main`.

### Starting Work

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/short-description
```

Use descriptive branch names: `feature/add-user-profiles`,
`fix/login-redirect-loop`, `docs/update-auth-guide`.

### During Development

1. Write the code
2. Write or update tests — all features must have tests
3. Update any relevant documentation (topic guides, ADRs, CLAUDE.md)
4. Run pre-commit checks (see below)
5. Commit with a clear message

### Finishing Work

```bash
git push -u origin feature/short-description
gh pr create --title "Add user profiles" --body "..."
```

After the PR is approved and merged:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/short-description
```

## Continuous Integration

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs automatically on
every push to `main` and on pull requests. It runs:

1. `pnpm lint` — Biome lint checks (no auto-fix — CI should fail on errors)
2. `pnpm typecheck` — TypeScript type checking
3. `pnpm test` — All Vitest tests
4. `pnpm build` — Production build

All four must pass before a PR can be merged. The workflow uses Node 22 with
pnpm via corepack and caches the pnpm store for fast installs.

## Pre-Commit Checks

Before committing, run these to catch issues early:

```bash
pnpm lint:fix     # Format and fix lint issues
pnpm typecheck    # Ensure no type errors
pnpm test         # Ensure tests pass
```

All three should pass before pushing. If you're making a work-in-progress
commit on your branch, at minimum run `pnpm lint:fix`.

## Commit Messages

Write commit messages that explain **why**, not just what. Use this format:

```
Short summary of the change (imperative mood, <70 chars)

Optional longer description explaining the motivation, approach,
or any non-obvious decisions. Wrap at 80 characters.
```

Examples of good commit messages:
- `Add user profile page with avatar upload`
- `Fix redirect loop when session cookie expires`
- `Replace axios with native fetch for API calls`

Examples of bad commit messages:
- `update stuff`
- `fix bug`
- `WIP`

## Testing Requirements

All features must have tests. The type of test depends on what you're building:

| What you built | What to test |
|---------------|-------------|
| Utility function | Unit test (`test/*.test.ts`) |
| UI component | Component test with Testing Library (`test/*.test.tsx`) |
| Form with validation | Test the Zod schema, test the action with invalid/valid data |
| New route with loader | Test the loader returns expected data |
| Database query | Test the query against a test database |

If you're unsure what to test, focus on behavior that matters to users — can
they complete the task the feature enables?

See [Testing](./testing.md) for details on writing tests.

## Documentation Updates

When you change code, update the relevant documentation:

- **Changed how a feature works?** Update the topic guide in `docs/`
- **Replaced a technology?** Write a new ADR in `docs/decisions/` and mark the
  old one as "Superseded"
- **Changed project structure?** Update the structure trees in `CLAUDE.md` and
  `docs/getting-started.md`
- **Added a new pattern?** Document it in the relevant topic guide and add it to
  `CLAUDE.md` under Key Patterns
- **Changed commands?** Update `CLAUDE.md` Quick Reference and
  `docs/getting-started.md`

Documentation should always reflect the current state of the code.

## Database Changes

There are two workflows for schema changes:

### During development (exploratory)

When you're still figuring out the schema:

```bash
# Edit app/db/schema.ts
pnpm db:push        # Apply changes directly (no migration files)
```

This is fast but doesn't create a migration history.

### For production-ready changes

When the schema is finalized:

```bash
# Edit app/db/schema.ts
pnpm db:generate    # Create migration files in drizzle/
pnpm db:migrate     # Apply the migration
```

Always use `db:generate` + `db:migrate` for changes that will be committed.
Migration files should be included in the PR so reviewers can see what's
changing in the database.

## Adding Dependencies

When adding a new package:

```bash
pnpm add package-name           # Runtime dependency
pnpm add -D package-name        # Dev dependency
```

Before adding a dependency, consider:
- Is there already something in the project that does this?
- Is the package actively maintained?
- How large is it? (check on [bundlephobia.com](https://bundlephobia.com/))
- Does it have TypeScript types?

When replacing a dependency with something new, write an ADR explaining why.

## Pull Request Format

PRs should include:

```markdown
## Summary
Brief description of what this PR does and why.

## Changes
- Bullet list of specific changes

## Test plan
- How to verify this works
- What tests were added
```

Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR. If a PR touches unrelated things,
split it up.
